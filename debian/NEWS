radxa-otgutils (0.3.0) stable; urgency=medium

  radxa-otgutils was never supposed to be enabled and started on boot by
  default. However, due to systemd enables all units according to the default
  preset policy [1], they were nevertheless enabled by default.

  Currently there is an issue where some services (like radxa-adbd) cannot be
  enabled on mutiple UDC controllers. As such, existing services are updated to
  take an UDC controller parameter to bind to that device. This has the side
  effect that now services won't be enabled on first boot (due to missing
  parameter).

  rsetup > 0.3.44 contains the support to manage radxa-otgutils' services.
